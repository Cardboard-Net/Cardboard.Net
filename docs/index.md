title: Cardboard.Net Documentation

[Cardboard.Net][1] is an unofficial .NET wrapper for the misskey api, it is inspired by projects targeting the discord api and a typescript based misskey library named cardboard. [Cardboard][2] [DSharpPlus][3] & [Discord.Net][4]. Discord.Net was one of my first introductions to C# programming. I hope this library serves the same thing for misskey/misskey fork users.
