This is just going to be a temporary directory in which I put a bunch of json payloads I have intercepted from the front end client of sharkey. I will use this to help build the various classes in API, and at a later date these might be moved to a testing projet, I want to have unit tests for serialization & deserialization of the various DTOs.
